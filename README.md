"# Siso-Web-Application" 

Develop a server side in the asp.net core that manages your tasks
When the server side returns Json files to the user I used Nlogger for working with Log files and using Mapper
The client side is written in Angular you have a user registration before you can insert new tasks
Using Angular reactive form for working with forms also
Working with http post, get, put to send the data to the server 
I also used CanActivate to prevent access to pages if they did not connect to the site  
use CanDeactivate in case they edited a form but did not save it
The site also has a Snake game using setInterval
